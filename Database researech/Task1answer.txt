✅ Comparison: Flat File Systems vs Relational Databases

| **Aspect**             | **Flat File Systems**                                                                                                                                      | **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Structure**       | • Data stored in plain text files, CSV, or simple spreadsheets.  <br>• No formal schema — structure is simple and unorganized.                             | • Data stored in tables with rows and columns. <br>• Has a defined schema (data types, constraints, keys). <br>• Supports indexing for fast access.                                      |
| **2. Data Redundancy** | • High redundancy — same data may appear in multiple files because there is no mechanism to prevent duplication.                                           | • Low redundancy — normalization reduces duplicate data. <br>• Referential integrity ensures consistency.                                                                                |
| **3. Relationships**   | • No support for relationships between data. <br>• Any linking must be manually written into application code.                                             | • Supports relationships using **primary keys** and **foreign keys**. <br>• Can establish one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.                                       |
| **4. Example Usage**   | • Small applications. <br>• Configuration files. <br>• Log files. <br>• Simple data storage without complex queries.                                       | • Enterprise systems (banking, hospitals, hotels). <br>• E-commerce platforms. <br>• HR systems and finance systems. <br>• Any system requiring complex queries and secure transactions. |
| **5. Drawbacks**       | • No security or access control. <br>• Hard to search or query large datasets. <br>• High risk of inconsistency. <br>• No relationships or data integrity. | • More complex to manage. <br>• Requires a database server. <br>• Higher cost and administrative overhead. <br>• Needs trained personnel (DBA).                                          |
