✅ Comparison: Flat File Systems vs Relational Databases

| **Aspect**             | **Flat File Systems**                                                                                                                                      | **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Structure**       | • Data stored in plain text files, CSV, or simple spreadsheets.  <br>• No formal schema — structure is simple and unorganized.                             | • Data stored in tables with rows and columns. <br>• Has a defined schema (data types, constraints, keys). <br>• Supports indexing for fast access.                                      |
| **2. Data Redundancy** | • High redundancy — same data may appear in multiple files because there is no mechanism to prevent duplication.                                           | • Low redundancy — normalization reduces duplicate data. <br>• Referential integrity ensures consistency.                                                                                |
| **3. Relationships**   | • No support for relationships between data. <br>• Any linking must be manually written into application code.                                             | • Supports relationships using **primary keys** and **foreign keys**. <br>• Can establish one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.                                       |
| **4. Example Usage**   | • Small applications. <br>• Configuration files. <br>• Log files. <br>• Simple data storage without complex queries.                                       | • Enterprise systems (banking, hospitals, hotels). <br>• E-commerce platforms. <br>• HR systems and finance systems. <br>• Any system requiring complex queries and secure transactions. |
| **5. Drawbacks**       | • No security or access control. <br>• Hard to search or query large datasets. <br>• High risk of inconsistency. <br>• No relationships or data integrity. | • More complex to manage. <br>• Requires a database server. <br>• Higher cost and administrative overhead. <br>• Needs trained personnel (DBA).                                          |






System Analyst

A system analyst studies business needs and designs the overall solution. They act as a bridge between users and the technical team.
They gather requirements, analyze workflows, identify problems, and propose system improvements. Their output guides developers and designers on what the system must accomplish.

Database Designer

A database designer creates the structure of the database.
They design tables, relationships, keys, and constraints to ensure data is stored efficiently, with minimal redundancy and high integrity. They focus on logical and physical database design, normalization, and data modeling using ERDs.

Database Developer

A database developer builds the actual database based on the designer's model.
They write SQL queries, triggers, stored procedures, views, and functions. They also optimize SQL performance and support applications that interact with the database.

DBA (Database Administrator)

A DBA manages and maintains the database after it is built.
They ensure security, backup, recovery, performance tuning, user access, and availability. They monitor the database daily and handle data-related incidents or performance issues.

Application Developer

An application developer builds the software that uses the database.
They write the front-end and back-end code, integrate the application with the database, and implement the features requested by users. They ensure that the user interface interacts correctly with the database.

BI (Business Intelligence) Developer

A BI developer works with analytical data rather than transactional data.
They create dashboards, reports, data warehouses, and visualizations. Their work helps organizations make decisions using insights extracted from large datasets.
