✅ Comparison: Flat File Systems vs Relational Databases

| **Aspect**             | **Flat File Systems**                                                                                                                                      | **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Structure**       | • Data stored in plain text files, CSV, or simple spreadsheets.  <br>• No formal schema — structure is simple and unorganized.                             | • Data stored in tables with rows and columns. <br>• Has a defined schema (data types, constraints, keys). <br>• Supports indexing for fast access.                                      |
| **2. Data Redundancy** | • High redundancy — same data may appear in multiple files because there is no mechanism to prevent duplication.                                           | • Low redundancy — normalization reduces duplicate data. <br>• Referential integrity ensures consistency.                                                                                |
| **3. Relationships**   | • No support for relationships between data. <br>• Any linking must be manually written into application code.                                             | • Supports relationships using **primary keys** and **foreign keys**. <br>• Can establish one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.                                       |
| **4. Example Usage**   | • Small applications. <br>• Configuration files. <br>• Log files. <br>• Simple data storage without complex queries.                                       | • Enterprise systems (banking, hospitals, hotels). <br>• E-commerce platforms. <br>• HR systems and finance systems. <br>• Any system requiring complex queries and secure transactions. |
| **5. Drawbacks**       | • No security or access control. <br>• Hard to search or query large datasets. <br>• High risk of inconsistency. <br>• No relationships or data integrity. | • More complex to manage. <br>• Requires a database server. <br>• Higher cost and administrative overhead. <br>• Needs trained personnel (DBA).                                          |






System Analyst

Database Developer

A database developer builds the actual database based on the designer's model.
They write SQL queries, triggers, stored procedures, views, and functions. They also optimize SQL performance and support applications that interact with the database.

DBA (Database Administrator)

A DBA manages and maintains the database after it is built.
They ensure security, backup, recovery, performance tuning, user access, and availability. They monitor the database daily and handle data-related incidents or performance issues.

Application Developer

An application developer builds the software that uses the database.
They write the front-end and back-end code, integrate the application with the database, and implement the features requested by users. They ensure that the user interface interacts correctly with the database.

BI (Business Intelligence) Developer

A BI developer works with analytical data rather than transactional data.
They create dashboards, reports, data warehouses, and visualizations. Their work helps organizations make decisions using insights extracted from large datasets.

Types of Databases — Brief Descriptions + Use Cases
1. Relational vs Non-Relational Databases
Relational Databases (RDBMS)

Store data in tables (rows and columns).

Use SQL for querying.

Support ACID transactions, making them reliable for structured data.

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

✔ Use Cases

Banking systems (transactions)

Inventory & billing systems

School/HR management systems

Any system with structured, consistent data

Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

Different data models: document, key-value, column-store, graph.

Examples

MongoDB → Document-based (JSON-like)

Cassandra → Column-store, highly scalable

Redis → Key-value in-memory

Neo4j → Graph database

✔ Use Cases

Social media feeds

Big data analytics

Real-time applications (chat apps)

IoT systems

Systems requiring fast reads/writes or flexible schemas

2. Centralized vs Distributed vs Cloud Databases
Centralized Database

All data is stored in one central location/server.

Easy to manage and control.

✔ Use Cases

Small companies

School database

Local accounting system

Distributed Database

Data is stored across multiple connected sites/servers.

Improves availability, performance, fault tolerance.

✔ Use Cases

Global e-commerce platforms (Amazon)

Banking systems with many branches

Telecom companies storing user data across regions

Cloud Database

Hosted on cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.

Offers scalability, automatic backups, pay-as-you-go model.

✔ Examples

Google Firestore

Azure SQL Database

✔ Use Cases

Mobile apps

SaaS applications

Startups requiring quick deployment

Any application needing auto-scaling




1. What is Cloud Storage and How It Relates to Databases

Cloud Storage is a model of storing data on remote servers hosted on the internet rather than on local physical drives. Cloud storage providers manage the infrastructure, security, and maintenance, allowing users to store and access data from anywhere.

Relation to Databases:

Cloud storage can serve as the underlying storage layer for cloud-based databases.

A cloud database is a database that runs on cloud computing platforms (like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) and stores data in cloud storage.

Cloud databases can be relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL):

Relational (SQL): Azure SQL Database, Amazon RDS (for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)

Non-relational (NoSQL): Amazon DynamoDB, Google Firestore

Essentially, cloud storage ensures your database data is stored remotely, scalable, and highly available.

2. Advantages of Cloud-Based Databases

Scalability

Easily scale storage and computing resources up or down based on demand.

Example: Amazon RDS can automatically increase storage when needed.

Cost-Effectiveness

Pay-as-you-go model: no need to invest in physical servers or maintenance.

Reduces upfront capital expenses.

High Availability & Reliability

Cloud providers often offer replication and redundancy across multiple data centers.

Reduces the risk of downtime or data loss.

Managed Services

Providers handle maintenance, patching, backups, and security updates.

Frees up IT teams to focus on development rather than infrastructure.

Global Accessibility

Users can access the database from anywhere over the internet.

Supports remote work and distributed teams.

Disaster Recovery

Built-in backup and recovery solutions help protect against data loss.

Some services (like Google Cloud Spanner) offer automatic failover.

3. Disadvantages of Cloud-Based Databases

Dependence on Internet Connection

Accessing the database requires a reliable internet connection.

Outages can temporarily prevent access.

Security & Privacy Concerns

Data is stored off-premises, which may raise compliance and privacy issues.

Sensitive data may require encryption and strict access controls.

Cost Over Time

While pay-as-you-go is flexible, long-term usage with heavy traffic can be expensive.

Scaling up compute or storage can lead to unexpectedly high bills.

Limited Control

Less control over the underlying hardware and some database configurations.

Certain advanced features may not be available depending on the provider.

Latency Issues

Access speed may be slower than on-premises databases for large datasets or high-frequency queries.
